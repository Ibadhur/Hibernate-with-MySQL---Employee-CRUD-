This project appears to be a Java application that integrates Hibernate for database interaction and MySQL as the database backend. 
This is a sample Java application demonstrating how to use Hibernate with MySQL to perform basic database operations (CRUD) on an Employee entity. It leverages Maven for dependency management and builds automation.

POM.xml: 	  This is the Maven configuration file specifying project details, dependencies (like MySQL Connector and Hibernate Core), and build settings.

Employee.java : 	  This class represents an Employee entity using JPA annotations (@Entity, @Table, @Id, @Column) for persistence mapping. It includes basic properties (empId, email, firstName, lastName) and corresponding getters/setters.

HibernateUtil.java : 		  This utility class sets up Hibernate's SessionFactory using Hibernate's native API without hibernate.cfg.xml. It configures Hibernate properties (Environment constants) and builds the session factory.

InterEmployeeDao.java and EmployeeDao.java : 		  These files define the DAO (Data Access Object) interface and its implementation for CRUD operations on the Employee entity. They utilize Hibernate's Session for transactions 
                                                (saveEmployee, updateEmployee, getEmployeeByEmpId, getAllEmployee, deleteEmployee).

App.java : 		  This is the main application class where EmployeeDao is instantiated and tested. It demonstrates CRUD operations (save, update, get, getAll, delete) on the Employee entity using Hibernate.
